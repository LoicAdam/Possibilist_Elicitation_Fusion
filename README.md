# Possibilist Elicitation Fusion

Repair inconsistency in possibilist elicitation with l-out-of-k fusion (and MCS). This contains all the needed code + results for our paper "Reasoning with uncertain preferences using possibility theory". Data used in the paper is not included, as it would be too voluminous. Files should be documented.

* elicitation_data_creation.py performs elicitations and l-out-of-k strategies.
* MCS_data_creation_from_kn.py performs MCS strategy.
* The two comparison.py files make comparisons between all the fusion methods/uncertainty management strategies.
* The two stat_test.R files contain statistical tests.
